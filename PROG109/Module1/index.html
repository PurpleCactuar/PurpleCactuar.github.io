        <h2>Module 1 - Introduction to Web Development</h2>

        <h3>Summary: </h3>
        
        <p>
            First week doing this in years and it was quite frustrating. I made a github webstite (<a href="https://purplecactuar.github.io/">PurpleCactuar.github.io</a>), which in itself was a disaster. 
		Let's be real, it's <i>still</i> a disaster. It took me so much time and tutorials to get it moderatly correct. 
		<br> The lecture we had talks about formats and tags for html. The chapters we covered in this module were 1-5, 
		which covered things like Structure, Lists, Links, Text and Images. 
		You know, that good stuff. 
            <br>
		<br>
		Sorry if there are some 404 errors. They have been my biggest headache but I'm working on it ðŸ˜¥
		<br>
            <br>

        <h3>What I learned... </h3>
        <p>
            I learned a LOT this week about html and github. I also learned that its very easy to continue to run in circles when trying to fix something (me, and 404 errors!). 
		I don't think I had a hard time completing the assignments but I did spend a copious of time figuring out Github. It made me feel behind and that caused me to stress out.
		I'm not sure how many hours of YouTube I put in since Wednesday but this hosting domain took me so much longer than I'd like to admit. <br>
		Despite, my sleepless nights, I'm pretty proud of myself for creeating this site. Its been several years since I messed around with HTML (RIP Myspace, forever in our hearts)
