        <h2>Module 1 - Introduction to Web Development</h2>

        <h3>Summary: </h3>
        
        <p>
            First week doing this in years and it was quite frustrating. I made a github webstite (<a href="PurpleCactuar.github.io">PurpleCactuar.github.io</a>), which in itself was a disaster. It took me so much time and tutorials to get it right. The lecture we had basically talks about formats and tags for html.

        <h3>What I learned... </h3>
        <p>
            I learned a LOT this week about html and github. I also learned that its very easy to continue to run in circles when trying to fix something.
