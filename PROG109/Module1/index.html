        <h2>Module 1 - Introduction to Web Development</h2>

        <h3>Summary: </h3>
        
        <p>
            First week doing this in years and it was quite frustrating. I made a github webstite (<a href="https://purplecactuar.github.io/">PurpleCactuar.github.io</a>), which in itself was a disaster. 
		Let's be real, it's <i>still</i> a disaster. It took me so much time and tutorials to get it moderatly correct. The lecture we had talks about formats and tags for html.
		You know, that good stuff. 
            <br>
		<br>
		Sorry if there are some 404 errors. They have been my biggest downfall but I'm working on it ðŸ˜¥

        <h3>What I learned... </h3>
        <p>
            I learned a LOT this week about html and github. I also learned that its very easy to continue to run in circles when trying to fix something.
