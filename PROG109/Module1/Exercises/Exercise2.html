	2 cups white sugar <br>
	4 eggs <br>
	1 ½ teaspoons vanilla extract <br>
	2 cups all-purpose flour <br>
	¾ teaspoon cream of tartar <br>
	½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder <br>
	½ cup chopped walnuts <br>

<p>Steps: </p>
<p><ol>
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking pan.
<br><br>
In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, then stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla. Combine the flour, cream of tartar and cocoa; stir into the egg mixture until well blended. Fold in walnuts. Spread half of this mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan.
<br><br>
Make the middle layer. In a medium bowl, stir together the coconut, sweetened condensed milk and 1 tablespoon vanilla. Carefully layer this over the chocolate layer in the pan. Top with the remaining chocolate batter. Spread to cover evenly.
<br><br>
Bake for 45 to 50 minutes in the preheated oven, until top is no longer shiny. Cool in the pan before cutting into bars.
