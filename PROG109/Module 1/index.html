I spent a lot of my time trying to learn Github. It made me feel stressed because I wanted to work on the            assignments instead of tinkering with this domain. I would say that I'm proud of myself for figuring it out. It took a lot of youtube            and google to get myself up and running. The internet is a fantastic place to learn and its amazing that all of these resources are            available for free. Cheers! ðŸ¥‚        </p>        <sub><a href="https://purplecactuar.github.io/">home page</a></sub>    </body></html>
