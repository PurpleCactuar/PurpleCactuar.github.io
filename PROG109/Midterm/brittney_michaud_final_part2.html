            Q: What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Answer: I had a minimum knowledge of HTML due to some basic coding a few years ago, but I hadn't used it in a long time. I've never used CSS but I felt that I had gotten the concept pretty quickly. JavaScript, I had never used or studied before and I thought it was the most difficult for me to grasp.

            Q: Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Answer: I found a blog-style template that I wanted to use and then I modified it. I created a 'template' page in Gitbub to be the main page that I could mess around with without having to update all of my pages. Then when I liked the way it looked, I updated all my other pages to look the same.

            Q: What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Answer: I found sticking to a theme was hard. I orginally wanted it to be more game-like but minimalist at the same time and that was a struggle for me.

            Q: How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? 
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Answer: I didn't know if I would enjoy web development but I actually quite like it. I feel as if I would be interested in staying front-end, though my degree is going to require me to learn back-end as well. I enjoyed learning CSS especially because I liked how I can manipulate and be creative.

            Q: What would you recommend to future students taking this class?
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Answer: Don't fall behind! The HTML and CSS concepts are not hard to grasp so be sure to get all of those assignments completed and done on time. I struggled with JavaScript and felt that one week learning the concepts was not enough for me. Supplement your learning with online resources and don't be afraid to ask for help. The best thing about learning code is the online resources and strangers who are willing to also answer questions for you.
