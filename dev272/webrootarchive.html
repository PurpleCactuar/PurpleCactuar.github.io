      <h2>All About Me</h2>
      <h5>In progress...</h5>
    
      <p>I would like to be called B or Blair. My legal name is Brittney, but I am changing it to Blair.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; I am originally from HI and moved to WA in 2017 with my (now) wife. 
		I have 3 pets- 2 dogs and a cat. In my free time, I read books! I am an ARC (Advance Reader Copy) reader, which means I receive books for free in exchange for 
		reviews. I have also done BETA reading, which is when you get a pre-edited copy of a book and share your thoughts about prose, timing, style, etc with the author. 
		One of my dogs is a Australian Shepherd, which means I am constantly outside doing activities with her. The other dog is a 12 year old Chi-Weenie who would rather
		sleep all day.<br>
I have an AA in Liberal Arts from Kapiolani Community College. I am currently pursuing a B.A in Software Development from Bellevue College. 
		I work full time as a Fraud Analyst at Nintendo of America.</p>
